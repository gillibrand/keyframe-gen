# Keyframe Generator

A quick-and dirty way to paste an image into a canvas and generate JavaScript animation keyframe that scale to match the top curve of the image. This works best with black and white images, and was specifically created to match the curve of a graph.

This is not very flexible—and is probably not helpful to most as-is—but might serve as a simple starting point for other quick tools to analyze an image.
